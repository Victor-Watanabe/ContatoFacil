### Introduction ###
 
 The project consists of facilitating access to companies throughout the Brazilian territory. Collecting some information such as: Names, Address, Telephone number and additional information by themselves.
 The objective is an automatic website to extract data obtained through the website https://www.google.com.br/maps/preview, thus acquiring data on companies of interest.
 
### Automation ###

FrameWork Selenium was used for the entire automated part of the project, thus locating the elements in the HTML of each page of the Website to make clicks and store data.

### Website Pages ###

Some frameworks were used to beautify the page and make it more responsive, such as: Tailwind and Bootstrap. Applied to all HTML on the Site.

### Error Pages ###

Thinking about possible errors (solvable and non-solvable), two error pages were created, with guidelines for correcting or avoiding them, presenting the appropriate pages according to the errors identified.
